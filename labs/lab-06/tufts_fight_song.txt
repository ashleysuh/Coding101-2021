Steady and true, rush along, Brown and Blue
Raise a mighty score today
Fearless tear down the field and never yield!
Brown and Blue, Brown and Blue for aye!
Hammer them hard, boys, and break through their guard
That is old Tuftonia's way
And our glorious banner once again will wave o'er Tuftonia's Day
T-U-F-T-S, T-U-F-T-S, Hurrah! Hurrah! for dear old Brown and Blue!

Up on the Hill tonight all will be gay
Victorious in the fight, we'll raise the standard of dear old Tufts to glory!
Pile up a mighty score
It's bound to soar
Now one goal more!
Nothing can stop us; it's Tuftonia's Day

Push it right through, boys, we're rooting for you! Now smash their guard once more
See, they are losing fast, their line can't last!
Brown and Blue, boys, forevermore
Right through the hole, lads, and make it a goal in the good old fashioned way
And we'll turn out with a lusty shout to honor Tuftonia's Day
T-U-F-T-S, T-U-F-T-S, Hurrah! Hurrah! for dear old Brown and Blue!
