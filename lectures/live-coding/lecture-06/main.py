# To practice our coding, we'll work on the 3 exercises in this project. If we run out of time, please come back and review the projects on your own.

# Each project is divided into its own file: exercise1.py, exercise2.py, exercise3.py. We'll import each of them here, and work with each project individually. They are unrelated, but by working on each project, we will practice our Python skills.

# Note that these (slightly modified) projects come directly from the homework assignment in Tufts' COMP 11 Introduction to Computer Science course. This assignment is given to students after completing the module on Functions.
