# Coding101-2021

Coding 101 Intensive is a 2-week summer program offered by the Tufts Pre-College Programs. Pre-college students (11-12th grade + incoming college freshmen) are selected worldwide based on their performance in prior STEM courses, SAT/ACT scores, professional recommendation letters, as well as their ability to engage in and learn brand new concepts. Each student who successfully completes the Coding 101 Intensive program receives 2 Tufts University credits towards their future degree.

This repository serves to hold all materials covered in the 2021 summer iteration of the Coding 101 Intensive program, led by [Ashley Suh](https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~asuh/) as the Program Instructor and [Ángelie Heredia Frías](https://as.tufts.edu/dataanalytics/people/students-alumni) as the Program Director. For an overview of the summer, including all panels and talks from academic & industry professionals, see the [uploaded schedule](https://github.com/ashleysuh/Coding101-2021/blob/main/Coding101_Schedule.pdf). Students were introduced to all coding oncepts that appear in the current COMP 11 (Intro to CS) curriculum at Tufts University, with the exception of recursion, over the course of only 10 days. 

Each day consisted of a 30 minute recap of the prior day's materials and lab solutions, 30 minutes of new lecture material via slides, 30 minutes of live/collaborative coding in Python/Replit, a 2 hour coding lab, and a 30 minute skills-building module. All [coding labs](https://github.com/ashleysuh/Coding101-2021/tree/main/labs) were developed and hosted by the TAs of the program. Lecture [slides](https://github.com/ashleysuh/Coding101-2021/tree/main/lectures/slides), [live-coding](https://github.com/ashleysuh/Coding101-2021/tree/main/lectures/live-coding), and skills-building modules were given by the program instructor (Ashley). The skills-building module consisted of live coding where students were taught: (1) how to develop their personal websites using HTML/CSS, and (2) how to develop an app prototype using Figma. All lecture material was created by the program instructor, with the help of several resources:

- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (Sweigart)
- Begin to Code in Python (Microsoft)
- COMP 11 (Mark Sheldon's Python course from 2018)
- [Replit's Intro to Python Curriculum](https://docs.replit.com/teaching-curriculum/intro-python)
- [Data Science Basics in Python](https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience/README.html)

Please ask the authors of the lectures and labs if you would like to use or share their materials.
