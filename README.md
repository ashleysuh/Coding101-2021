# Coding101-2021

Coding 101 Intensive is a 2-week summer program offered by the Tufts Pre-College Programs. Pre-college students (9th-12th grade + incoming college freshmen) are selected worldwide based on their performance in prior STEM courses, SAT/ACT scores, professional recommendation letters, as well as their ability to engage in and learn brand new concepts. Each student who successfully completes the Coding 101 Intensive program receives 2 Tufts University credits towards their future degree.

This repository serves to hold all materials covered in the 2021 summer iteration of the Coding 101 Intensive program. For an overview of the summer, see the uploaded schedule. For perspective, students were introduced to all concepts that appear in the current COMP 11 (Intro to CS) curriculum at Tufts University, with the exception of recursion, over the course of 10 days. 

Each day consisted of a 30 minute recap of the prior day's materials and lab solutions, 30 minutes of new lecture material via slides, 30 minutes of live/collaborative coding in Python/Replit, and a 2 hour coding lab. Each coding lab was developed and hosted by the TAs of the program. Lecture material was created by the program instructor (Ashley Suh), with the help of several resources:

- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (Sweigart)
- Begin to Code in Python (Microsoft)
- COMP 11 (Mark Sheldon's Python course from 2018)
- Intro to Python Curriculum (Replit - https://docs.replit.com/teaching-curriculum/intro-python)
- Data Science Basics in Python (https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience/README.html)

Please ask the authors of the lectures and labs if you would like to use or share their materials.
